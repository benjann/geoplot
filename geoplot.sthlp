{marker description}{...}
{title:Description}

{pstd}
    {cmd:geoplot} draws maps from shape files and other datasets prepared by
    {helpb geoframe}. The procedure is to first create one or several frames
    containing the source data using {helpb geoframe} and then apply
    {cmd:geoplot} to plot the data from these frames.

{pstd}
    Multiple layers of elements such as regions, borders, lakes, roads, labels,
    etc., can be freely combined, and the look of the elements can be varied
    depending on the values of variables.

{pstd}
    Some of the functions used by {cmd:geoplot} and {helpb geoframe} are provided
    in Mata library lgeoplot.mlib. See {helpb lgeoplot_source} for source and
    minimal documentation of these functions.

{pstd}
    {cmd:geoplot} requires {helpb colorpalette}, {helpb colrspace}, and
    {helpb moremata}. To install these packages type

        {com}. {stata ssc install palettes}{txt}
        {com}. {stata ssc install colrspace}{txt}
        {com}. {stata ssc install moremata}{txt}

    {cmd:area} {it:frame} [[{cmd:i.}]{help geoplot##zvar:{it:zvar}}] {ifin} {weight}
    [{cmd:,} {it:options} ]

{pstd}
    where {it:frame} is the frame containing the shapes to be
    plotted (see {helpb geoframe}; {it:frame} can be a shape frame or an
    attribute frame that is linked to a shape frame), {help geoplot##zvar:{it:zvar}}
    is an optional variable to determine styling, and {it:weight}, specified as
    {cmd:[}{cmdab:w:eight}{cmd:=}{it:exp}{cmd:]} or
    {cmd:[}{cmdab:iw:eight}{cmd:=}{it:exp}{cmd:]}, rescales the coordinates of
    the shapes by the absolute (and normalized) values of {it:exp}. {it:options}
    are as follows.

{phang}
    {it:{help geoplot##zopts:zvar_options}} determine the look of
    the shapes (e.g. color) depending on the values of
    {help geoplot##zvar:{it:zvar}} as described
    {help geoplot##zvar_options:below}.

{phang}
    {cmd:wmax}[{cmd:(}{it:#}{cmd:)}] specifies a custom upper bound for
    normalization of weights. This is only relevant if {it:{help weight}} has
    been specified. The default is to normalize by max(1,{it:wmax}), where
    {it:wmax} is the observed maximum of the (absolute) weights (within
    layer). Specify {opt wmax(#)} to normalize by {it:#}. Specify {cmd:wmax}
    without argument to normalize by {it:wmax} even if {it:wmax}<1.

{marker size}{...}
{phang}
    {cmdab:si:ze(}{it:{help exp}}[{cmd:,} {opt s:cale(#)} {opt d:max(#)}]{cmd:)}
    resizes the shapes such that their sizes are proportional to {it:exp}
    (typically, {it:exp} is a {varname}; the size of a shape is equal to the
    area covered by the shape). Default normalization is such that the shape
    with the highest density (within layer), defined as abs({it:exp}) divided
    by the area of the shape, will keep its original size. Negative values in
    {it:exp} will be treated as positive; shapes for which {it:exp} is missing
    will keep their original size.

{pmore}
    Suboption {cmd:scale()} multiplies all sizes by {it:#} (after
    normalization). Suboption {cmd:dmax()} specifies a custom maximum density
    for normalization; use this option to make sizes comparable across layers.

{phang}
    {opth sel:ect(exp)} selects the shapes to be included in the
    plot. {cmd:select()} is applied after determining the cuts for {it:zvar}
    and after processing weights and {cmd:size()}. Specify {it:{help if}} or
    {it:{help in}} if you want to select observations upfront.

{phang}
    {opth if:shp(exp)} specifies an additional {it:if} condition to be applied to
    the shape frame. This is relevant if {it:frame} is an attribute frame is
    linked to a shape frame. Observations in the shape frame that do not
    satisfy the specified condition (i.e., observations for which {it:exp} evaluates
    to zero), as well as units in the attribute frame for which the condition
    leads to an empty selection in the shape frame, will be excluded. If {it:frame}
    is a shape frame (i.e. not an attribute frame linked to a shape frame), {cmd:ifshp()}
    is treated in the same way as the {it:{help if}} qualifier.

{phang}
    {cmdab:ec:olor(}{help colorpalette##colorlist:{it:colorspec}}{cmd:)}
    sets the fill color used for enclaves. {it:colorspec} is a (single) color
    specification as described in
    {helpb colorpalette##colorlist:colorpalette}. Default is
    {cmd:ecolor(white)}. The color of an enclave will only be visible if not
    covered by a corresponding exclave.

{phang}
    {it:{help area_options}} affect the look of areas as
    described in {helpb twoway area}. For example, use option {cmd:lcolor()} to
    set the outline color. Color options support {it:colorspec} as described in
    {helpb colorpalette##colorlist:colorpalette}.

{phang}
    {opt lock} causes the shapes to be unaffected by global
    options {helpb geoplot##project:project()} and
    {helpb geoplot##angle:angle()}, apart from location. For example,
    if {cmd:lock} is specified, {helpb geoplot##angle:angle()} will rotate
    only the positions of the shapes, but not their orientation.

{phang}
    {opt box}[{cmd:(}{it:suboptions}{cmd:)}] draws a bounding box around the
    plotted shapes. {it:suboptions} are as follows.

{phang2}
    {cmd:padding()}, {cmd:rotate}, {cmd:hull}, {cmd:circle}, {cmd:n()}, {cmd:angle()},
    and {cmd:noadjust} as described in help {helpb geoframe##bbox:geoframe bbox}.

{phang2}
    {cmdab:ref:ine} adds extra points to the edges of the box. Specify this
    suboption to avoid undesired artifacts when applying global option
    {helpb geoplot##project:project()}.

{phang2}
    {opt line} plots the bounding box using plot type {helpb geoplot##line:line}. The
    default is to plot the bounding box using plot type {helpb geoplot##area:area}. Note
    that, by default, the bounding box does not have a fill color even if option
    {cmd:line} is omitted. Specify {cmd:color(}{help colorpalette##colorlist:{it:colorspec}}{cmd:)} or
    {cmd:fcolor(}{help colorpalette##colorlist:{it:colorspec}}{cmd:)} to set a
    fill color.

{phang2}
    {it:{help area_options}} or {it:{help line_options}}, depending on whether
    option {cmd:line} has been specified, are regular graph options to affect
    the look of the bounding box. Color options support {it:colorspec} as described in
    {helpb colorpalette##colorlist:colorpalette}.

{phang}
    {opt f:eature(string)} specifies the type of feature represented in the
    layer. The default is to use the setting returned by
    {helpb geoframe##get:geoframe get feature}.

{phang}
    {opt coor:dinates(X Y)} specifies custom coordinate variables. The default
    is to use the variables returned by
    {helpb geoframe##get:geoframe get coordinates}.

{phang}
    {opt pl:evel(PLEVEL)} specifies a custom plot level variable. The default is
    to use the variable returned by {helpb geoframe##get:geoframe get plevel}.

{phang}
    {opt id(ID)} specifies a custom ID variable. The default is
    to use the variable returned by {helpb geoframe##get:geoframe get id}. An ID
    variable is not strictly needed, but if available it will be taken into
    account when categorizing {help geoplot##zvar:{it:zvar}}.

{phang}
    {opt centr:oids(X Y)} specifies custom centroid variables. The default is
    to use the variables returned by
    {helpb geoframe##get:geoframe get centroids}. If centroids are needed and
    no centroid variables are found, the centroids are computed on the fly using
    {helpb geoframe##generate:geoframe generate centroids}. The centroids are
    needed if weights, option {cmd:size()}, or option {cmd:lock} is specified.

{phang}
    {opt area(AREA)} specifies a custom shape size variable. The default is to
    use the variable returned by
    {helpb geoframe##get:geoframe get area}. If shape sizes are needed and no
    shape size variable is found, the sizes are computed on the fly using
    {helpb geoframe##generate:geoframe generate area}. Shape sizes
    are only needed if option {cmd:size()} is specified.

{pstd}
    By default, the shapes do not have a fill color. Specify
    {help geoplot##zvar:{it:zvar}} to color the shapes depending on the values
    of {help geoplot##zvar:{it:zvar}}. Specify
    {cmd:fcolor(}{help colorpalette##colorlist:{it:colorspec}}{cmd:)} to set a
    single fill color for all shapes.

    {opt centroids()}, and {cmd:area()} are
    options as described for layer type {helpb geoplot##area:area}.

{phang}
    {it:{help line_options}} affect the look of lines as
    described in {helpb twoway line}. For example, use option {cmd:lwidth()} to
    set the width of lines. Color options support {it:colorspec} as described in

    where {it:frame} is the frame containing the points to be

    {cmd:[}{cmdab:w:eight}{cmd:=}{it:exp}{cmd:]} or
    {cmd:[}{cmdab:iw:eight}{cmd:=}{it:exp}{cmd:]}, scales the size of the
    markers by the absolute (and normalized) values of {it:exp} (also see
    {help scatter##remarks14:Weighted markers} in {helpb twoway scatter}). {it:options}
    are as follows.

{phang}
    {it:{help geoplot##zopts:zvar_options}}, {cmd:wmax()}, {cmd:select()},
    {cmd:ifshp()}, {cmd:lock}, {opt box()}, {opt coordinates()}, {opt id()},

    options as described for layer type {helpb geoplot##area:area}.

{phang}
    {it:{help marker_options}}, {it:{help marker_label_options}},
    {it:{help connect_options}}, and {it:jitter_options} affect
    the look of markers as described in {helpb twoway scatter}. For example,
    use option {cmd:msymbol()} to set the marker symbol. Color options
    support {it:colorspec} as described in {helpb colorpalette##colorlist:colorpalette}.

{phang}
    {cmd:shp} causes points to be plotted at the coordinates from the
    linked shape frame. By default, layer type {cmd:point} uses the coordinates
    from {it:frame} even if {it:frame} is linked to a shape frame. Option {cmd:shp} has
    no effect if {it:frame} is not linked to a shape frame.

    and {help geoplot##zvar:{it:zvar}} is an optional
    variable to determine styling.

{pstd}
    The syntax of {it:labelspec} is as follows. To print labels from a variable, type

    The default is {cmd:circle}. For {cmd:arc} and
    {cmd:slice}, argument {it:angle} in [-360,360] specifies the size of the
    segment in degrees; default is {cmd:180} (half circle). In case of
    {cmd:arc} you may want to specify option {cmd:line} (see below) to prevent
    connecting the first and the last point. For {cmd:pin} and {cmd:pin2}, argument
    {it:headsize} in [0,1] specifies the size of the head; default is one third for
    {cmd:pin} and 0.6 for {cmd:pin2}.

{pmore}
    Use {opt shape(numlist)} or {opt shape(matname)} to
    create a custom symbol. {it:{help numlist}} is a list of shape coordinates specified
    as

            {it:x1} {it:y1} [{it:x2} {it:y2} ...]

{pmore}
    {it:matname} is the name of a matrix containing the shape coordinates. The matrix may
    contain a single row or column of consecutive points or it may contain two
    rows or two columns, one for X and one for Y. For example, to create a
    kite symbol, you could type

            {cmd:shape(0 -1 .5 0 0 .5 -.5 0 0 -1)}

{pmore}
    or you could define a matrix such as

            {cmd:matrix KITE = (0, -1, .5, 0, 0, .5, -.5, 0, 0, -1)}

{pmore}
    or

            {cmd:matrix KITE = (0, .5, 0, -.5, 0)', (-1, 0, .5, 0, -1)'}

{pmore}
    and then type {cmd:shape(KITE)}. Furthermore, you may create a custom symbol
    by defining a Mata function
    {cmd:_geo_symbol_}{it:name}{cmd:()} and then call the function
    as {cmd:shape(}{it:name} [{it:arg}]{cmd:)}. Two arguments will be submitted to
    the function, real scalar {it:n} and string scalar {it:arg}. The function must
    return a numeric {it:r} x 2 matrix containing the (X,Y)
    coordinates of the symbol (or a {it:r} x 3 matrix containing the
    coordinates in the first two columns and a plot level indicator in the
    third column; use the plot level indicator in multi-part symbols
    to create white space by setting the plot level to 0 for
    regular parts and to 1 for white-space parts; more precisely, the parts
    of the symbol will be printed in ascending order of the plot level with
    even-level parts treated as regular parts and odd-level parts treated as
    white space). For example, to create a kite symbol, define function

            {com}real matrix _geo_symbol_Kite(real scalar n, string scalar arg)
            {
                pragma unused n
                pragma unused arg

                return(((0, .5, 0, -.5, 0)',(-1, 0, .5, 0, -1)'))
            }{txt}

{pmore}
    and then type {cmd:shape(Kite)}. Multipart symbols can be
    created by introducing a missing point between parts.

{phang}
    {opt n(n)} sets the number of points used to draw a circle. Technically,
    a circle is drawn as a polygon with {it:n} edges; if {it:n} is large enough,
    the polygon appears as a smooth circle. This also means that you can use {cmd:shape(circle)}
    with low {it:n} to create regular polygons. In fact, symbols
    {cmd:triangle}, {cmdab:square}, ..., {cmd:octagon} are implemented as
    {cmd:shape(circle)} with {it:n} set to 3, 4, ..., 8, respectively. For {cmd:shape(circle)},
    the default is {it:n} = 100. For {cmd:shape(arc} {it:angle}{cmd:)} and
    {cmd:shape(slice} {it:angle}{cmd:)} the default is {it:n} =
    max(2, ceil(abs({it:angle})/360 * 100)). For {cmd:shape(pin)} and {cmd:shape(pin2)}, the default
    is {it:n} = max(4, ceil({it:headsize} * 100)).

{phang}
    {opt align(align)} changes the zero point of the selected symbol shape, which
    determines how the shape is aligned to the coordinate of its position. {cmd:align()}
    is applied to the raw symbol shape, before applying options such as {cmd:ratio()},
    {cmd:size()}, {cmd:angle()}, or {cmd:offset()}.

{pmore}
    {it:align} can contain one of {cmdab:l:eft} and {cmdab:r:ight}, one of
    {cmdab:b:ottom} and {cmdab:t:op}, as well as {cmdab:c:enter}. For example,
    type {cmd:align(bottom)} to move the zero point to the bottom, or type
    {cmd:align(top left)} to move it to the top left corner. The default is to
    leave the zero point unchanged, which is at the center for most shapes; type
    {cmd:align(center)} if you want to recenter shapes that do not have their
    zero point at the center. {cmd:left}, {cmd:right}, {cmd:bottom}, and {cmd:top}
    take precedence over {cmd:center}.

{phang}
    {opt ratio(#)} adjusts the ratio between the height and the width of the symbols. The default
    is {cmd:ratio(1)}. For example, type {cmd:ratio(2)} to double the height.

{phang}
    {opt ang:le(angle)} rotates the symbols by {it:angle} degrees (counterclockwise). Global
    option {helpb geoplot##angle:angle()} has no effect on the orientation of the symbols.

{phang}
    {cmdab:si:ze(}[{cmd:*}]{it:exp}{cmd:)} sets or adjusts the size of the symbols. For
    the predefined symbols, {cmd:size()} sets the length of the
    radius of the circle enclosing the symbol (i.e. the distance between the center
    and the outermost point). For custom symbols, {cmd:size()} sets
    the unit length of the specified coordinates. Type {opt size(exp)} to specify
    an absolute size (i.e. in units of the underlying
    map). Alternatively, specify {cmd:size(*}{it:exp}{cmd:)} to multiply the default
    size by {it:exp}. The default size is set to 3% of the minimum of the horizontal
    and vertical size of the underlying map (as it exists at the point when the
    symbols are added, including the positions of the symbols; the smallest possible
    default size is 1).

{phang}
    {cmdab:off:set(}{it:offset} [{it:angle}]{cmd:)} offsets the positions of the
    symbols by {it:offset} percent of {cmd:size()} in the direction of {it:angle}. The
    default {it:angle} is 0 (east). For example, set {it:angle} to 90 for north, 180
    for west, or -45 for south-east.

{phang}
    {opt line} plots the symbols using plot type {helpb geoplot##line:line}. The
    default is to plot the symbols using plot type {helpb geoplot##area:area}. Note
    that, by default, the symbols do not have a fill color even if option
    {cmd:line} is omitted. Specify {help geoplot##zvar:{it:zvar}} to color the
    symbols depending on the values of {help geoplot##zvar:{it:zvar}}. Specify
    {cmd:color(}{help colorpalette##colorlist:{it:colorspec}}{cmd:)} or
    {cmd:fcolor(}{help colorpalette##colorlist:{it:colorspec}}{cmd:)} to set a
    single fill color for all symbols.

{phang}
    {it:{help area_options}} or {it:{help line_options}}, depending on whether
    option {cmd:line} has been specified, are regular graph options to affect
    the look of the symbols. Color options support {it:colorspec} as described in
    {helpb colorpalette##colorlist:colorpalette}.

{phang}
    {it:{help marker_label_options}} to add marker labels.

{phang}
    {it:{help geoplot##zopts:zvar_options}}, {cmd:wmax()}, {cmd:select()}, {cmd:ecolor()}, {cmd:box()},
    {opt feature()}, and {opt coordinates()} are options as described for layer type
    {helpb geoplot##area:area}.

{pstd}
    where {it:frame} is the frame containing the positions and data of
    the pie charts (see {helpb geoframe}), {it:varlist} specifies the variables
    determining the slice sizes (a separate pie chart will be created for each
    unit/row in the data), and
    {it:weight}, specified as {cmd:[}{cmdab:w:eight}{cmd:=}{it:exp}{cmd:]} or
    {cmd:[}{cmdab:iw:eight}{cmd:=}{it:exp}{cmd:]}, scales the pie charts by the
    absolute (and normalized) values of {it:exp}. {it:options}
    are as follows.

{phang}
    {opt asis} omits normalization of the values provided by {it:varlist}. By
    default, the values will be normalized such they sum to 100 across {it:varlist}
    in each row of the data. Option {cmd:asis} may be useful if the provided
    values are percentages and you want to leave part of the pie blank
    if the percentages do not sum up to 100.

{phang}
    {opt expl:ode(spec)} displays exploded pie charts. An exploded pie
    chart is a pie chart in which one or more slices are moved out from the
    center. {it:spec} may be {it:#} to move all slices out by {it:#} percent of
    the radius of the pie. Alternatively, {it:spec} may be

            {it:index} = {it:#} [{it:index} = {it:#} ...]

{pmore}
    where {it:index} is the index of the slice to be moved out ({cmd:1} for the
    slice corresponding to the first variable, {cmd:2} for the second, etc.)
    and {it:#} is the value of the shift in percent of the radius of the pie.

{phang}
    {opt polar} causes polar area diagrams to be displayed rather than regular
    pie charts. A polar area diagram is a pie chart in which each slice has the
    same angle and the values from {it:varlist} determine how far the
    slices extend from the center of the pie. In a regular pie chart the values of
    {it:varlist} determine the angles of the slices and all slices extend from the
    center by the same amount.

{phang}
    {opt rev:erse} travels in counterclockwise direction around the circle. The
    default is to arrange the slices in clockwise order.

{phang}
    {opt mid} shifts the start of the first slice by half its angle. By default,
    the edge of the first slice starts at 90 degrees (north). Specify {cmd:mid}
    to center the first slice at 90 degrees.

{phang}
    {opt ang:le(angle)} rotates the pies by {it:angle} degrees
    (counterclockwise). The default is {cmd:angle(90)} such that the first
    slice of a pie starts at an angle of 90 degrees (north). For example, type
    {cmd:angle(0)} place the first slice at 0 degrees (east). Global
    option {helpb geoplot##angle:angle()} has no effect on the orientation of the pies.

{phang}
    {cmdab:si:ze(}[{cmd:*}]{it:exp}{cmd:)} sets or adjusts the size of the
    pies. Type {opt size(exp)} to specify an absolute size (i.e. in units of the underlying
    map) for the radius of the pie. Alternatively, specify {cmd:size(*}{it:exp}{cmd:)}
    to multiply the default radius by {it:exp}. The default radius is set to 3% of the minimum
    of the horizontal and vertical size of the underlying map (as it exists at the point when the
    pies are added, including the positions of the pies; the smallest possible
    default radius is 1).

{phang}
    {cmdab:off:set(}{it:offset} [{it:angle}]{cmd:)} offsets the positions of the
    pies by {it:offset} percent of their radius in the direction of {it:angle}. The
    default {it:angle} is 0 (east). For example, set {it:angle} to 90 for north, 180
    for west, or -45 for south-east.

{phang}
    {opt out:line}[{cmd:(}{it:options}]{cmd:)} adds an outline circle to each pie
    by calling layertype {helpb geoplot##symbol:symbol}. This may
    be useful, for example, to complete the circle for the part of a pie that may be
    left empty if {cmd:asis} is specified, to draw a reference outline in
    case of {cmd:polar}, or to create doughnut charts. {it:options} are as follows.

{phang2}
    {opt below} plots the outlines below the pie charts. The the default is
    to plot the outlines on top.

{phang2}
    {opt now:eight} requests that the specified weights be ignored when
    determining the sizes of the outlines.

{phang2}
    {cmd:size()}, {cmd:ratio()}, {cmd:n()}, {cmd:offset()}, {cmd:line},
    and {it:{help area_options}} or {it:{help line_options}} are
    options as described for layertype {helpb geoplot##symbol:symbol}. Several
    of these options will be set automatically, which can be overridden by specifying
    the options explicitly. {cmd:size(*}{it:#}{cmd:)} will be interpreted
    as {it:#} times the size used for the pies.

{phang}
    {opt n(n)} sets the number of points used to draw a circle. Default is
    {cmd:n(100)}. Each slice will use a fraction of points corresponding to the
    angle of the slice (with an imposed minimum of 2 points).

{phang}
    {opt nolab:el} uses variable names rather variable labels in the legend.

{phang}
    {it:{help geoplot##zopts:zvar_options}}, {cmd:wmax()}, {cmd:select()},

    {it:weight}, specified as {cmd:[}{cmdab:w:eight}{cmd:=}{it:exp}{cmd:]} or
    {cmd:[}{cmdab:iw:eight}{cmd:=}{it:exp}{cmd:]}, scales the bar charts by the
    absolute (and normalized) values of {it:exp}. {it:options}
    are as follows.

{phang}
    {opt nostack} unstacks the bars. The default is to display stacked bar
    charts. Specify {cmd:nostack} if you want to display regular (unstacked) bar charts.

{phang}
    {opt asis} omits normalization of the values provided by {it:varlist}. By
    default, the values will be normalized such they sum to 100 across {it:varlist}
    in each row of the data. Option {cmd:asis} may be useful if the provided
    values are percentages and you want to leave part of the bar chart blank
    if the percentages do not sum up to 100.

{phang}
    {opt rev:erse} arranges the bars in reverse order.

{phang}
    {opt ang:le(angle)} rotates the bar charts by {it:angle} degrees
    (counterclockwise). The default is to display upright bar charts. For
    example, Type {cmd:angle(-90)} for horizontal bar charts (west to east). Global
    option {helpb geoplot##angle:angle()} has no effect on the orientation of the bars.

{phang}
    {cmdab:si:ze(}[{cmd:*}]{it:exp}{cmd:)} sets or adjusts the size of the
    bar charts. Type {opt size(exp)} to specify an absolute size (i.e. in units of
    the underlying map) for the width of the charts. Alternatively, specify {cmd:size(*}{it:exp}{cmd:)} to
    multiply the default width by {it:exp}. The default width is set to 3% of the minimum

    point when the bar charts are added, including the positions of the bar charts;
    the smallest possible default width is 1).

{phang}
    {opt ratio(#)} adjusts the ratio between the height and the width of the
    bars charts. The default is {cmd:ratio(2)}.

{phang}
    {cmdab:off:set(}{it:offset} [{it:angle}]{cmd:)} offsets the positions of the
    bar charts by {it:offset} percent of their width in the direction of {it:angle}. The

{marker zvar}{...}
{pstd}
    Many layer types support variable {help varname:{it:zvar}} (or
    {cmd:i.}{help varname:{it:zvar}}) as an argument. Specify {it:zvar}
    to determine the colors and other aspects of the
    units displayed in the layer by the values of {it:zvar}. The
    range of values of {it:zvar} will be divided into levels and each
    level will be represented by a different style. Use the options below to
    determine how {it:zvar} is divided into levels, how the levels will be
    styled, and how the levels will be represented in the legend. Type
    {cmd:i.}{it:zvar} to treat {help varname:{it:zvar}} as a categorical
    variable. Each value of {it:zvar} will then be treated as a separate
    level. Likewise, if {it:zvar} is a string variable, each unique value of
    {it:zvar} will be treated as a separate level.

{marker discrete}{...}
{phang}
    {opt discr:ete} treats {help geoplot##zvar:{it:zvar}} as a discrete
    variable. Each unique value of {help geoplot##zvar:{it:zvar}} will be treated as a
    separate level. Typing {cmd:i.}{it:zvar} implies {cmd:discrete}. Note that
    {cmd:i.}{it:zvar} only allows positive and integer values, while
    {cmd:discrete} does not impose such a restriction. If {it:zvar} is a string
    variable, {cmd:discrete} is implied.

{marker levels}{...}
{phang}
    {cmd:levels(}[{it:#}][{cmd:,} {it:method} {opth w:eight(varname)}]{cmd:)} specifies the number of
    levels to be formed by {help geoplot##zvar:{it:zvar}}. By default, a regular grid
    (equidistant cuts) of 5 intervals from the observed minimum to the observed
    maximum of {help geoplot##zvar:{it:zvar}} will be used (first interval closed, remaining intervals
    left-open). Specify {opt levels(#)} to create {it:#} intervals. Specify suboption {it:method}
    to use a non-regular grid, where {it:method} can be one of the following.

{p2colset 13 23 25 2}{...}
{p2col: {cmdab:q:uantile}}use quantiles as cuts
    {p_end}
{p2col: {cmdab:k:means}}use cuts determined by {helpb cluster kmeans}
    {p_end}

{pmore}
    The number of resulting levels may be less than {it:#} with these methods, depending on the
    distribution of {help geoplot##zvar:{it:zvar}}. In case of {cmdab:quantile}, weights to be taken
    into account when computing the quantiles can be specified in suboption {cmd:weight()}. Option
    {cmd:levels()} has no effect if {cmd:i.}{it:zvar} or
    {helpb geoplot##discrete:discrete} is specified, or if {it:zvar} is a string variable.

{marker cuts}{...}
{phang}
    {opth cuts(numlist)} is an alternative to {cmd:levels()} and
    provides custom breaks for the levels to be formed by
    {help geoplot##zvar:{it:zvar}}. For continuous {help geoplot##zvar:{it:zvar}},
    specify {it:#}+1 breaks to form {it:#} intervals (first interval closed, remaining
    intervals left-open). Observations with values below the first break or above
    the last break will be ignored.

{pmore}
    If {cmd:i.}{it:zvar} or {helpb geoplot##discrete:discrete}
    is specified, {it:numlist} is interpreted as the distinct values of
    {help geoplot##zvar:{it:zvar}} to be selected. In this case, {it:numlist}
    also affects the order in which the levels are printed in the legend. Behavior
    is similar if {it:zvar} is a string variable, except that the
    values in {it:numlist} are interpreted as indices of alphabetically sorted
    values.

{marker colorvar}{...}
{phang}
    {cmd:colorvar(}[{cmd:i.}]{it:zvar}{cmd:)} is an alternative to specifying
    [{cmd:i.}]{help geoplot##zvar:{it:zvar}} as an argument. If both are specified,
    {opt colorvar()} will take precedence.

{marker color}{...}
{phang}
    {cmd:color(}[{it:{help colorpalette##palette:palette}}] [{cmd:,}
    {it:{help colorpalette##opts:palette_options}}]{cmd:)}
    selects the colors to be used for the levels. {it:palette} is any
    palette allowed by {helpb colorpalette} (which can also be a simple list of colors, see
    help {it:{help colorpalette##colorlist:colorlist}}) and {it:palette_options} are
    corresponding options. For example, type {cmd:colors(hcl bluered, reverse)} for a
    red to blue HCL color scheme. The default is {cmd:color(st)} if
    {cmd:i.}{it:zvar} or {helpb geoplot##discrete:discrete} is specified or if
    {it:zvar} is a string variable; in all other cases the default is
    {cmd:color(viridis)}. An appropriate number of colors will automatically
    be retrieved from {it:palette} (applying interpolation or recycling, if necessary,
    depending on type of palette). Specify a single color if you do not want
    the color to depend on the values of {help geoplot##zvar:{it:zvar}}.

{pmore}
    If {help geoplot##zvar:{it:zvar}} is omitted, {cmd:color()}
    is interpreted as a standard graph option; in this case, the syntax is
    {cmdab:color(}{help colorpalette##colorlist:{it:colorspec}}{cmd:)}.

{phang}
    {opt lwidth(list)},

    {opt msize(list)},
    {opt msangle(list)},
    {opt mlwidth(list)},
    {opt mlabsize(list)}, and
    {opt mlabangle(list)} specify lists of line widths, line pattern, fill
    intensities, markers symbols, marker sizes, marker angles, marker outline
    widths, marker label sizes, and marker label angles to be used for the
    levels. The availability of these options depends on layer type; for example,
    marker options will be available with {helpb geoplot##point:point}, but not
    with {helpb geoplot##area:area} or {helpb geoplot##line:line}.

{pmore}
    {it:list} can be a {it:{help numlist}} or an appropriate
    {it:stylelist} ({it:{help linewidthstyle}list},
    {it:{help linepatternstyle}list},
    {it:{help intensitystyle}list},
    {it:{help symbolstyle}list},
    {it:{help markersizestyle}list},
    {it:{help anglestyle}list}, or
    {it:{help textsizestyle}list}). Specify {it:{help numlist}} with exactly two
    elements, e.g. {cmd:lwidth(0.5 1)}, to use a regular grid of values
    between the two numbers. In all other cases, the specified
    elements will be recycled if the number of levels is larger than the
    number of elements in {it:list}. Omit an option or specify a single
    element, e.g. {cmd:lwidth(thin)}, if you want to keep a property
    constant across levels.

{pmore}
    If {help geoplot##zvar:{it:zvar}} is omitted, the options are
    interpreted as a standard graph options with their regular syntax.

{marker mlabcolor}{...}
{phang}
    {cmd:mlabcolor(}[{it:{help colorpalette##palette:palette}}] [{cmd:,}
    {it:{help colorpalette##opts:palette_options}}]{cmd:)} is like
    {helpb geoplot##color:color()} but affects marker labels
    only.

{marker label}{...}
{phang}
    {cmd:label(}[{it:labelinfo}] [{cmd:,} {it:options}]{cmd:)} determines how
    the levels formed by {help geoplot##zvar:{it:zvar}} will be labeled in
    the legend. {it:labelinfo} is

            [{it:value} [{cmd:=}]] {it:label} [ {it:value} [{cmd:=}] {it:label} {it:...} ]

{pmore}
    where {it:value} is the index (continuous or string {it:zvar}) or
    value (categorical {it:zvar}) of the level to be affected and {it:label} is

            {cmd:"}{it:text}{cmd:"} [{cmd:"}{it:text}{cmd:"} {it:...}]

{pmore}
    (a multiline label will be created if {it:label} contains multiple
    {cmd:"}{it:text}{cmd:"} elements).

{pmore}
    {it:value} may be {it:#} to select a specific level
    (e.g., {cmd:1} for the 1st level,
    {cmd:2} for 2nd level, etc.) or it may be a specification including
    wildcard characters {cmd:*} and {cmd:?} to select multiple levels
    (e.g. {cmd:?} for levels 1-9, {cmd:1?} for levels 10-19, {cmd:*} for all
    levels). In any case, the label of the first matching
    specification will be assigned. You may also type {cmd:label(}{it:label}{cmd:)}
    rather than {cmd:label(}{cmd:*} = {it:label}{cmd:)} to assign the
    same (type of) label to all levels.

{pmore}
    {it:text} may include the following placeholders:

{p2colset 13 20 22 2}{...}
{p2col: {cmd:@lb}}lower bound of the interval
    {p_end}
{p2col: {cmd:@mid}}middle of the interval
    {p_end}
{p2col: {cmd:@ub}}upper bound of the interval
    {p_end}
{p2col: {cmd:@lab}}value label in case of categorical {it:zvar}, {cmd:@lb - @ub} in case of continuous {it:zvar}
    {p_end}
{p2col: {cmd:@n}}number of units
    {p_end}

{pmore}
    In case of {cmd:i.}{it:zvar} or {helpb geoplot##discrete:discrete}, or if {it:zvar} is a string variable,
    the default is {cmd:label("@lab")}. For example, type {cmd:label("@lab (@n)")} to
    include the number of units in the label. For continuous {help geoplot##zvar:{it:zvar}},
    the default is equivalent to {cmd:label(1 = "[@lb,@ub]" * = "(@lb,@ub]")}. For example,
    type {cmd:label("@lb - @ub")} or {cmd:label("@lab")} to create labels
    formatted as "{it:lb} - {it:ub}", where {it:lb} and {it:ub} are the lower
    and upper bounds of the intervals.

{pmore}
    {it:options} are as follows.

{phang2}
    {opt nol:abel} omits the use of value labels in case of {cmd:i.}{it:zvar} or
    {helpb geoplot##discrete:discrete}.

{phang2}
    {opth f:ormat(%fmt)} selects the display format to be applied to numeric
    values. The default is to use the display format of {help geoplot##zvar:{it:zvar}}.

{phang2}
    {opt r:everse} reverses the order of the legend keys.

{pmore}
    If {help geoplot##zvar:{it:zvar}} is omitted in a layer (such that, technically,
    the layer only contains a single level), type {cmd:label(}{it:label}{cmd:)} to
    set the label of the layer's legend key (the default is to use the name of
    the plotted frame as label). The above {it:options} and placeholders are ineffective in this case.

{marker gloptions}{...}
{phang}
    {opt gl:options(options)} provides override options to be applied to
    the symbols created by {helpb geoplot##glegend:glegend()}. Depending on layer
    type, these are {it:{help area_options}},
    {it:{help line_options}}, or {it:{help marker_options}}.

{marker nolegend}{...}
{phang}
    {opt nolegend} requests that the current layer not be considered for the
    legend that is displayed by default if there are layers containing a
    {help geoplot##zvar:{it:zvar}}. {opt nolegend} only affects the default
    behavior; you can still include the layer manually in the legend using the
    legend's {cmd:layer()} suboption.

{marker missing}{...}
{phang}
    {opt missing(options)} specifies the styling of elements for which {help geoplot##zvar:{it:zvar}}
    is missing, where {it:options} are as follows.

{phang2}
    Standard rendering options depending on layer type, such as {cmd:color()},
    {cmd:lwidth()}, {cmd:lpattern()}, etc. In case of {helpb geoplot##area:area},
    the default is to use color {cmd:gs14} for areas for which {help geoplot##zvar:{it:zvar}} is missing.

{phang2}
    {cmdab:lab:el("}{it:text}{cmd:"} [{cmd:"}{it:text}{cmd:"} {it:...}]{cmd:)}
    sets a label for missing in the legend. The default is
    {cmd:"no data"}. Multiple lines are created if multiple
    {cmd:"}{it:text}{cmd:"} elements are specified. {cmd:@n} can be used in
    {it:text} as a placeholder for the number of missing units.

{phang2}
    {opt nolab:el} omits missing from the legend.

{phang2}
    {opt first} places missing at the top (or leftmost) rather than at
    the bottom (or rightmost) of the legend.

{phang2}
    {opt nogap} omits the gap between missing and the other keys in the legend.

{phang2}
    {opt gl:options(options)} provides override options to be applied to
    the missing symbol created by {helpb geoplot##glegend:glegend()}.

{dlgtab:Global options}

{marker background}{...}
{phang}
    {cmd:background}[{cmd:(}{it:options}{cmd:)}] draws a (rectangular)
    background frame behind the map, where {it:options} are as follows.

{phang2}
    {opt water} sets the feature type of the background to {cmd:water}, affecting
    how the background will be rendered by default.

{phang2}
    {opt l:imits(limits)} specifies custom limits for the size of the
    background frame, where {it:limits} is

                {it:xmin} {it:xmax} {it:ymin} {it:ymax}

{pmore2}
    The default is to use the observed limits of the coordinates included in the
    map. Elements in {it:limits} that are omitted
    or specified as {cmd:.} (missing) are set to the default.

{phang2}
    {opt pad:ding(marginexp)} adds padding to limits of the background frame. This is
    only relevant for limits that are determined automatically, not for custom
    limits. The values in {it:marginexp} are in percent of the size of the map
    in each direction. For example, type {cmd:padding(5)} to increase the frame
    by 5% on each side; type {cmd:padding(-5)} decrease by 5%. Provide multiple
    values in {it:marginexp} to use different padding on the left, right,
    bottom, and top (in this order; values will be recycled). Alternatively,
    specify one or more elements of the form
    {{cmd:l}|{cmd:r}|{cmd:b}|{cmd:t}} [{cmd:=}] {it:#}, such as
    {cmd:padding(l=5)} (add 5% padding on the left; no padding on other sides)
    or {cmd:padding(r=5 t=10)} (add 5% padding on the right and 10% padding at the top;
    no padding on other sides).

{phang2}
    {opt n(#)} specifies number of points used to draw each edge of the
    background frame. Default is {cmd:n(1)} or, if {helpb geoplot##project:project()}
    is specified, {cmd:n(100)}.

{phang2}
    {it:{help area_options}} affect the look of the background
    frame as described in {helpb twoway area}. By default, only the outline will be
    displayed (unless option {cmd:water} is specified). Specify option
    {cmd:color()} to display a filled frame (without
    outline); use options {cmd:fcolor()} and {cmd:lcolor()} to set the colors
    of fill and outline separately. Color options support
    {it:colorspec} as described in {helpb colorpalette##colorlist:colorpalette}.

{marker grid}{...}
{phang}
    {cmd:grid}[{cmd:(}{it:options}{cmd:)}] draws grid lines on top of the
    map. {cmd:grid()} can be repeated to draw multiple grids. {it:options} are
    as follows.

{phang2}
    {cmd:x()}, {cmd:y()}, {cmd:tight}, {cmd:padding()}, {cmd:radian},
    {cmd:noextend}, {cmd:mesh}, and {cmd:n()} define the lines as described in
    {helpb geoframe##grid:geoframe grid}. If {cmd:grid()} is repeated, shapes
    created by earlier calls to {cmd:grid()} will be included in the
    computations.

{phang2}
    {it:{help line_options}} affect the look of lines as
    described in {helpb twoway line}. For example, use option {cmd:lwidth()} to
    set the width of lines. Color options support {it:colorspec} as described in
    {helpb colorpalette##colorlist:colorpalette}.

{phang2}
    {cmdab:lab:els}[{cmd:(}{it:options}{cmd:)}] adds axis labels,
    where {it:options} are as follows.

{p 12 16 2}
    {opt p:ositions(list)} selects the sides to be labeled and fine-tunes the
    positioning of the labels. Argument {it:list} is one or more elements of the form

                    {{cmd:l}|{cmd:r}|{cmd:b}|{cmd:t}} [[{cmd:=}] {it:{help clockpos}}]

{p 16 16 2}
    where {cmd:l} prints labels on the left, {cmd:r} on the right, {cmd:b} at the
    bottom, and {cmd:t} at the top, and {it:{help clockpos}} fine-tunes the
    positioning. Default {it:{help clockpos}} is {cmd:9} for {cmd:l}, {cmd:3} for
    {cmd:r}, {cmd:6} for {cmd:b}, and {cmd:12} for {cmd:t}.

{p 16 16 2}
    The default is {cmd:positions(l b)} or, more precisely,
    {cmd:positions(l=9 b=6)} or {cmd:positions(l 9 b 6)}. Type, for example,
    {cmd:positions(l r b t)} to print labels on all four sides.

{p 12 16 2}
    {opth f:ormat(%fmt)} or {opth f:ormat(exp)} formats the labels. Use
    {opth f:ormat(%fmt)} to apply a numerical format as
    described in {helpb format}; use {opth f:ormat(exp)} for more involved
    formatting, where {it:exp} is a string expression. Within {it:exp}, use
    {cmd:X} for the numerical value and {cmd:axis} for the axis
    to which a label belongs (1 = X axis, 2 = Y axis). For example,

{p 22 24 2}
    {com}format(string(X,"%9.1f") + "{&degree}"){txt}

{p 16 16 2}
    displays the labels with one decimal place and a degree symbol. Likewise,

{p 22 24 2}
    {com}format(string(abs(X)) + "{&degree}" + cond(X>0, cond(axis==1,"E","N"), cond(X<0, cond(axis==1,"W","S"), ""))){txt}

{p 16 16 2}
    displays the labels in absolute degrees including compass direction.

{p 12 16 2}
    {cmd:size()}, {cmd:color()}, {cmd:angle()}, {cmd:tstyle()}, and {cmd:gap()}
    affect the rendering of the labels as described for {it:layertype}
    {helpb geoplot##labels:label}.

{marker tissot}{...}
{phang}
    {cmd:tissot}[{cmd:(}{it:options}{cmd:)}] draws Tissot's
    indicatrices on top of the map, where {it:options} are as follows.

{phang2}
    {cmd:r()}, {cmd:x()}, {cmd:y()}, {cmd:tight}, {cmd:padding()}, {cmd:radian},
    and {cmd:n()} define the indicatrices as described in
    {helpb geoframe##tissot:geoframe tissot}.

{phang2}
    {it:{help area_options}} affect the look of the indicatrices as described
    in {helpb twoway area}. By default, only the outline will be
    displayed. Specify option {cmd:color()} to display a filled frame (without
    outline); use options {cmd:fcolor()} and {cmd:lcolor()} to set the colors
    of fill and outline separately. Color options support
    {it:colorspec} as described in {helpb colorpalette##colorlist:colorpalette}.

{phang2}
    {cmdab:mark:ers}[{cmd:(}{it:{help marker_options}}{cmd:)}] displays a marker at the
    center of each indicatrix, where {it:marker_options} affect
    the look of markers as described in {helpb twoway scatter}. For example,
    use option {cmd:msymbol()} to set the marker symbol. Color options
    support {it:colorspec} as described in {helpb colorpalette##colorlist:colorpalette}.

{marker project}{...}
{phang}
    {cmd:project}[{cmd:(}[{it:projection} [{it:args}]] [{cmd:,} {opt rad:ian}]{cmd:)}]
    applies the specified projection, where {it:projection} and {it:args} are
    as described in {helpb geoframe##project:geoframe project}. Original
    coordinates are assumed to represent latitude (Y) and longitude (X) in
    degrees (typically WGS84); specify suboption {cmd:radian} if the
    coordinates are in radians. If {cmd:project} is specified without
    arguments, the {cmd:webmercator} projection is applied.

{marker angle}{...}
{phang}
    {opt angle(angle)} rotates the map by {it:angle} degrees
    (counterclockwise). {cmd:rotate()} is a synonym for {cmd:angle()}.

{marker legend}{...}
{phang}
    {cmd:legend}[{cmd:(}{it:options}{cmd:)}] prints a legend for one or several
    layers, employing official Stata's legend option. {it:options} are as follows:

{phang2}
    {opt l:ayout(layout)} selects and arranges the layers to be included in the
    legend. {it:layout} is

                {it:el} [ {it:el} ... ]

{pmore2}
    where {it:el} is one of

{p2colset 17 26 28 2}{...}
{p2col: {it:#}}include the legend keys of layer {it:#}
    {p_end}
{p2col: {cmd:.}}add a gap
    {p_end}
{p2col: {cmd:|}}start a new column (or a new row)
    {p_end}
{p2col: {cmd:-} {it:title}}add a subtitle, where {it:title} is
    {cmd:"}{it:text}{cmd:"} [{cmd:"}{it:text}{cmd:"} {it:...}]
    {p_end}

{pmore2}
    Series of {it:#} elements can be specified using shorthand notation as described
    in {it:{help numlist}}. {opt laye:rs()} can be used as a synonym for {cmd:layout()}.

{phang2}
    {opt bot:tom} aligns the legend keys at the bottom (rightmost) if there are multiple
    columns (rows) in the legend. The default is to align the keys at the top (leftmost).

{phang2}
    {opt hor:izontal} arranges the legend horizontally (i.e., in rows). The default is to
    arrange the legend vertically (in columns).

{phang2}
    {opt rev:erse} reverses the order of the legend keys within layers.

{phang2}
    {opth pos:ition(compassdirstyle)} overrides the default location of the legend,
    which is in the upper right corner.

{phang2}
    {opt out:side} places the legend outside of the plot region. The default is
    to place the legend inside the plot region.

{phang2}
    {it:contents} and {it:location} options are further options to affect the
    rendering of the legend as documented in {it:{help legend_option}}. Be
    careful with options {cmd:order()}, {cmd:rows()}, {cmd:cols()}, and
    {cmd:colfirst}, as these options are set automatically by {cmd:geoplot} and
    you may not want to override these settings. Option
    {cmd:bplacement()} will be ignored.

{pmore}
    Type {cmd:legend(off)} or {cmd:nolegend} to suppress the legend that is printed by default if
    {help geoplot##zvar:{it:zvar}} has been specified in at least one layer.

{marker glegend}{...}
{phang}
    {cmd:glegend}[{cmd:(}{it:options}{cmd:)}] prints a legend for one or several
    layers, employing a custom procedure that does not make use of
    official Stata's legend option. Unlike the standard {helpb geoplot##legend:legend()} option,
    {cmd:glegend()} supports the inclusion of symbols created by layertype
    {helpb geoplot##symbol:symbol}. Furthermore, {cmd:glegend()} can be repeated to
    create multiple legends. {it:options} are as follows:

{phang2}
    {opt l:ayout(layout)} selects and arranges the layers to be included in the
    legend. {it:layout} is

                {it:el} [ {it:el} ... ]

{pmore2}
    where {it:el} is one of

{p2colset 17 26 28 2}{...}
{p2col: {it:layers}}include the legend keys of the specified layers
    {p_end}
{p2col: {cmd:.}}add a gap between layers
    {p_end}
{p2col: {cmd:|}}start a new column
    {p_end}
{p2col: {cmd:-} {it:title}}add a subtitle, where {it:title} is
    {cmd:"}{it:text}{cmd:"} [{cmd:"}{it:text}{cmd:"} {it:...}]
    {p_end}

{pmore2}
    and {it:layers} is a single {it:#} to include the keys of layer {it:#}, a
    {it:{help numlist}} to include the keys from multiple layers (one after
    the other), or

                {it:#1} {cmd:&} {it:#2} [ {cmd:&} {it:#3} ... ]

{pmore2}
    to include legend keys with composite symbols from two or more
    layers (i.e., symbols from multiple layers printed on top of each
    other; labels will be determined in such as way that for
    each key the last non-empty label is printed). {opt laye:rs()}
    can be used as a synonym for {cmd:layout()}.

{phang2}
    {opt bot:tom} aligns the legend keys at the bottom if there are multiple
    columns in the legend. The default is to align the keys at the top.

{phang2}
    {opt rev:erse} reverses the order of the legend keys within layers.

{phang2}
    {opth pos:ition(compassdirstyle)} overrides the default location of the legend,
    which is in the upper right corner. Default is {cmd:position(ne)}. The
    legend will always be placed inside the plot region; use global option
    {helpb geoplot##margin:margin()} to make space for the legend if needed.

{phang2}
    {cmd:box}[{cmd:(}{it:{help area_options}}{cmd:)}] prints a frame around the
    the legend. Color options in {it:area_options} support {it:colorspec} as
    described in {helpb colorpalette##colorlist:colorpalette}.

{phang2}
    {opt symy:size(#)} and {opt symx:size(#)} specify the height and width of the
    space used for the keys' symbols, in percent
    of the map's {help geoplot##refdim:reference size}. Defaults are
    {cmd:symysize(3)} and {cmd:symxsize(3)}.

{phang2}
    {opt syms:cale(#)} specifies the relative size of symbols from layertype
    {helpb geoplot##symbol:symbol}, in proportion to the height set by
    {cmd:symysize()}. Default is {cmd:symscale(0.8)}.

{phang2}
    {opt rowg:ap(#)} specifies the vertical gap between legend keys, in percent
    of the map's {help geoplot##refdim:reference size}. Default is
    {cmd:rowgap(0)}.

{phang2}
    {opt colg:ap(#)} specifies the horizontal gap between legend columns, in percent
    of the map's {help geoplot##refdim:reference size}. Default is
    {cmd:colgap(3)}.

{phang2}
    {opt keyg:ap(#)} specifies the horizontal gap between the symbol
    and the label of a key, in percent
    of the map's {help geoplot##refdim:reference size}. Default is
    {cmd:keygap(1)}.

{phang2}
    {opt textf:irst} places labels before symbols. The default
    is to place symbols before labels.

{phang2}
    {opth textw:idth(numlist)} specifies the width of the space used for the keys' labels,
    in percent of the map's {help geoplot##refdim:reference size}. Default is
    {cmd:textwidth(12)}. Unlike the standard {helpb geoplot##legend:legend()}
    option, {cmd:glegend()} uses a fixed width and does not adjust the size
    to the content of the labels; use option {cmd:textwidth()} to adjust the
    space if it is too wide or too narrow. Specify multiple values to use
    different widths across columns (values will be recycled).

{phang2}
    {opt ta:lign(align)} specifies the alignment of the labels, where
    {it:align} can be {opt l:eft}, {opt c:enter}, or {opt r:ight}. Default is
    {cmd:talign(left)} or, if {cmd:textfirst} is specified,
    {cmd:talign(right)}.

{phang2}
    {opth tsi:ze(textsizestyle)},
    {cmdab:tcol:or(}{help colorpalette##colorlist:{it:colorspec}}{cmd:)},
    and {opth tang:le(anglestyle)} specify the size, color, and angle of the
    labels. Defaults are {cmd:tsize(vsmall)} and {cmd:tcolor(black)}.

{phang2}
    {opt linesk:ip(#)} specifies the size of the lineskip in multiline
    labels, in percent of the map's
    {help geoplot##refdim:reference size}. Default is {cmd:lineskip(2)}.

{phang2}
    {opt headsk:ip(before after)} specifies extra vertical gaps to be added
    before and after subtitles. Default is {cmd:headskip(1 0.5)}.

{phang2}
    {opt ha:lign(align)} specifies the alignment of subtitles, where
    {it:align} can be {opt l:eft}, {opt c:enter}, or {opt r:ight}. Default is
    {cmd:halign(left)}.

{phang2}
    {opth hsi:ze(textsizestyle)},
    {cmdab:hcol:or(}{help colorpalette##colorlist:{it:colorspec}}{cmd:)},
    and {opth hang:le(anglestyle)} specify the size, color, and angle of the
    subtitles. Default is the same setting as for labels.

{phang2}
    {opt nospan} restricts the space of subtitles to the space used for labels. By default,
    the subtitles span the combined space of symbols and labels.

{phang2}
    {cmd:title()}, {cmd:margin()}, {cmd:xmargin()}, and {cmd:ymargin()} as
    described for the {helpb geoplot##inset:inset()} option.

{marker slegend}{...}
{phang}
    {cmd:slegend(}{it:values} [{cmd:,} {it:options}]{cmd:)} prints a legend
    for symbol sizes created by applying weights in layertype
    {helpb geoplot##symbol:symbol}. {cmd:slegend()} can be repeated to
    create multiple legends. Argument {it:values} specifies the sizes
    (values of the weighting variable) to be included in the legend. The syntax
    of {it:values} is

            {it:{help numlist}} [{cmd:"}{it:label}{cmd:"} [{it:numlist} [{cmd:"}{it:label}{cmd:"}] ... ]]

{pmore}
    where {it:label} specifies a custom label for the preceding value. The
    default is to use numeric values as labels. {it:options} are as follows:

{phang2}
    {opt l:ayer(#)} selects the layer for which the legend be created. The default
    is to use the first {helpb geoplot##symbol:symbol} layer to which weights have
    been applied. No legend will be created if there is no such layer.

{phang2}
    {opt over:lay}[{cmd:(}{it:offset}{cmd:)}] creates a legend with overlayed
    symbols. Use optional argument {it:offset} to stagger the positions of the
    symbols, where {it:offset} specifies the proportion of each symbol's width
    that is used to shift the symbols.

{phang2}
    {opt tfl:oat} makes the horizontal positions of labels dependent on the
    sizes of the symbols. The default is to align the labels at a fixed position.

{phang2}
    {opt sa:lign(align)} specifies the alignment of the symbols, where
    {it:align} can be {opt l:eft}, {opt c:enter}, or {opt r:ight}. Default is
    {cmd:salign(center)}.

{phang2}
    {cmdab:head:ing(}{cmd:"}{it:text}{cmd:"} [{cmd:"}{it:text}{cmd:"} ...]{cmd:)}
    specifies a heading (subtitle) for the legend.  Multiple lines are
    created if multiple {cmd:"}{it:text}{cmd:"} elements are specified. Use
    options such as {cmd:halign()}, {cmd:hsize()}, and {cmd:hcolor()} to format
    the heading (see below).

{phang2}
    {opth f:ormat(fmt)} selects the display format to be applied to numeric
    labels.

{phang2}
    {cmd:reverse}, {cmd:position()}, {cmd:box()}, {cmd:symysize()},
    {cmd:symxsize()}, {cmd:rowgap()}, {cmd:keygap()}, {cmd:textfirst},
    {cmd:textwidth()}, {cmd:talign()}, {cmd:tsize()}, {cmd:tcolor()},
    {cmd:tangle()}, {cmd:lineskip()}, {cmd:headskip()}, {cmd:halign()},
    {cmd:hsize()}, {cmd:hcolor()}, {cmd:hangle()}, {cmd:nospan},
    {cmd:title()}, {cmd:margin()}, {cmd:xmargin()}, and {cmd:ymargin()} as
    described for option {helpb geoplot##glegend:glegend()}, with the following
    differences: default for {cmd:position()} is {cmd:sw}; default for
    {cmd:symysize()} and {cmd:symxsize()} is {cmd:2}; default for
    {cmd:rowgap()} is {cmd:1}; {cmd:headskip()} only has a single argument
    specifying the extra gap after the subtitle.

{phang2}
    {cmd:line} and {it:{help area_options}} or {it:{help line_options}} affect
    the rendering of the symbols as described for layertype
    {helpb geoplot##symbol:symbol}. By default, {cmd:slegend()} displays
    raw symbols without applying rendering options. For
    example, use option {cmd:color()} to add color.

{marker clegend}{...}
{phang}
    {cmd:clegend}[{cmd:(}{it:options}{cmd:)}] prints a {help clegend_option:contour} plot legend
    of the colors used in one of the layers that include
    {help geoplot##zvar:{it:zvar}} with a {help geoplot##color:color gradient}
    (requires Stata 18). {it:options} are as follows.

{phang2}
    {opt l:ayer(#)} selects the layer for which the legend be created. The default
    is to use the first layer containing a color gradient. For example, if layers
    3 and 4 in a graph contain {help geoplot##zvar:{it:zvar}} with a
    {help geoplot##color:color gradient}, type {cmd:layer(4)} to create a legend
    for layer 4.

{phang2}
    {opth f:ormat(%fmt)} select the display format to be applied to the values
    in the legend labels. The default is to use the display format of
    {help geoplot##zvar:{it:zvar}}.

{phang2}
    {opt cuts(keyword)} determines how ticks and labels are used to indicated
    the cuts between the color levels. {it:keyword} may be {cmd:none} (do not
    indicate the cuts), {cmdab:lab:el} (major ticks plus labels), {cmdab:ti:ck}
    (major ticks only), {cmdab:mlab:el} (minor ticks plus labels), and {cmdab:mti:ck}
    (minor ticks only). Default is {cmd:cuts(label)}. You may use options
    {helpb axis_label_options:zlabel()}, {helpb axis_label_options:ztick()},
    {helpb axis_label_options:zmlabel()}, and {helpb axis_label_options:zmtick()}
    outside of {cmd:clegend()} to add further ticks and labels or to override the
    ticks and labels added by {cmd:cuts()}. {cmd:cuts()} has no effect if
    {help geoplot##zvar:{it:zvar}} is {helpb geoplot##discrete:discrete}

{phang2}
    {opt nolab:el} omits the use of value labels. This is only relevant
    if {help geoplot##zvar:{it:zvar}} is {helpb geoplot##discrete:discrete}.

{phang2}
    {opt mis:sing} requests that missing value is
    included in the legend. Use option {helpb geoplot##missing:missing()} to
    set the label for missing.

{phang2}
    {opth pos:ition(compassdirstyle)} overrides the default location of the legend,
    which is in the lower right corner.

{phang2}
    {opt out:side} places the legend outside of the plot region. The default is
    to place the legend inside the plot region.

{phang2}
    {it:clegend_suboption} are further options to affect the rendering of the
    legend as documented in {it:{help clegend_option}}. For example, use options
    {opth width(size)} and {opth height(size)} to set the size of the legend. Option
    {cmd:bplacement()} will be ignored.

{pmore}
    The rendering of the axis included in the contour legend is controlled by
    options specified outside of {cmd:clegend()}. In particular, use
    option {helpb axis_title_options:ztitle()} to set the axis title, options
    {helpb axis_label_options:zlabel()} and {helpb axis_label_options:ztick()}
    to affect the axis labels and ticks, and option
    {helpb axis_scale_options:zscale()} to control further aspects of the axis.

{marker sbar}{...}
{phang}
    {cmd:sbar}[{cmd:(}{it:options}{cmd:)}] adds a scale bar to the map. {it:options}
    are as follows.

{phang2}
    {opt s:cale(#)}, {it:#}>0, determines the size of units of the scale bar. Default is
    {cmd:scale(1000)}. That is, by default, if coordinates are in meters, the
    scale bar will be in kilometers.

{phang2}
    {opt l:ength(#)}, {it:#}>0, sets the length of the scale bar in units of
    the scale bar. {cmd:geoplot} will abort with error
    if the resulting scale bar is too large (i.e., has
    coordinates outside of the plotregion). An appropriate
    length is determined automatically if {cmd:length()} is omitted.

{phang2}
    {opt n(#)} sets the number of segments in the scale bar. Default is
    {cmd:n(5)}.

{phang2}
    {opt even} causes even segments to be filled. The default is to fill
    odd segments.

{phang2}
    {opt h:eight(#)}, {it:#}>=0, sets the height of the bar in percent of
    the map's reference size; see {helpb geoplot##refdim:refdim()}. Default is
    {cmd:height(1)}. {cmd:geoplot}
    will abort with error if the resulting scale bar is too large (i.e., has
    coordinates outside of the plotregion).

{phang2}
    {opt lab:el(options)} affects the rendering of the numeric labels, where
    {it:options} are {it:{help textbox_options}} such as {cmd:color()} or {cmd:size()}
    (defaults are {cmd:color(black)} and {cmd:size(vsmall)}), {cmd:minmax} to label
    only the minimum and maximum, {opt a:bove} to place the labels above the
    scale bar (rather than below), and {opth f:ormat(fmt)} to set the display
    format; default is {cmd:format(%8.0g)}. Type {opt nolab:el} to omit the numeric
    labels.

{phang2}
    {opt u:nits(text)} specifies text to be appended to the rightmost label. Use
    this to denote units, e.g., {cmd:units(km)}.

{phang2}
    {cmdab:ti:tle(}{cmd:"}{it:text}{cmd:"} [{cmd:"}{it:text}{cmd:"} ...][{cmd:,} {it:suboptions}]{cmd:)}
    adds a title to the scale bar. Multiple lines are created if multiple
    {cmd:"}{it:text}{cmd:"} elements are specified. {it:suboptions} are
    {opth pos:ition(compassdirstyle)} to set the position
    of the title (default is at the top) as well as {it:{help textbox_options}} such
    as {cmd:color()} or {cmd:size()} to affect the rendering of the title; color
    options support {it:colorspec} as described in
    {helpb colorpalette##colorlist:colorpalette}. Option
    {cmd:title()} can be repeated to create multiple titles.

{phang2}
    {opth pos:ition(compassdirstyle)} overrides the default location
    of the scale bar, which is in the lower left corner.

{phang2}
    {opt xm:argin(#)} and {opt ym:argin(#)} specify how much the
    scale bar will be moved away from the edge of the plotregion, in percent of the map's
    reference size; see {helpb geoplot##refdim:refdim()}. Defaults are {cmd:xmargin(1)}
    and {cmd:ymargin(3)}.

{phang2}
    {it:{help area_options}} are general options to affect the rendering of the
    scale bar, such as {cmd:color()} or {cmd:lwidth()}. Defaults are
    {cmd:color(black)}, {cmd:fintensity(100)}, and {cmd:lwidth(vthin)}.

{marker compass}{...}
{phang}

    (counterclockwise).

{phang2}
    {opt si:ze(#)}, {it:#}>=0, sets the size (or half-size) of the compass
    in percent of the map's reference size; see {helpb geoplot##refdim:refdim()}. The default
    is {cmd:size(5)}. For compass type 1, {cmd:size()} sets the half-size; for compass types
    2 and 3, {cmd:size()} sets the size. {cmd:geoplot} will abort with error if the resulting
    compass is too large (i.e., has coordinates outside of the plotregion).

{phang2}
    {opt lab:el}[{cmd:(}{it:options}{cmd:)}] affects the contents and
    rendering of the compass labels, where {it:options}
    are: {opt t:ext(labels)} to override the default labels, which are
    {cmd:text("N" "S" "E" "W")} for compass type 1 and {cmd:text("N")}
    for compass types 2 and 3; {opt g:ap(#)} to determine how far the
    labels will be moved out from the edge of the compass, where argument
    {it:#}, with default value {cmd:30}, is in percent of the size (or half-size)
    of the compass; as well as {it:{help textbox_options}} such as
    {cmd:color()} or {cmd:size()}. Default settings are

{phang2}
    {it:{help area_options}} are general options to affect the rendering of the
    compass, such as {cmdab:c:olor()} or {cmdab:lw:idth()}. Defaults are
    {cmd:color(black)}, {cmd:fintensity(100)}, and {cmd:lwidth(vthin)}.

{marker zoom}{...}
{phang}
    {opt zoom(spec)} magnifies the objects from selected layers. Option {cmd:zoom()}
    can be repeated to magnify multiple sets of objects. The syntax of
    {it:spec} is

            {it:layers}{cmd::} {it:scale} [{it:offset} [{it:angle}]] [{cmd:,} {it:options}]

{pmore}
    where {help numlist:{it:layers}} is a list of layer numbers and {it:scale} is a scaling
    factor. For example, type {cmd:zoom(2/4: 2.5)} to magnify the objects in layers 2 through 4
    by factor 2.5. Argument {it:offset} specifies the distance by which the objects be moved
    and {it:angle} specifies the direction of the move in degrees. The default {it:offset}
    is 0 (no move) and the default {it:angle} is 0 (east). For example, type
    {cmd:zoom(2/4: 2.5 100 90)} to move the objects by 100 percent (1 radius)
    in northward direction. {it:options} are as follows.

{phang2}
    {opt ot:ype(type)} sets the scaling of the {it:offset} argument, where
    {it:type} may be one of the following.

{p2colset 13 23 25 2}{...}
{p2col:{cmdab:z:oom}}{it:offset} is in percent of the radius (half-diagonal)
    of the zoom's bounding box (or minimum enclosing circle), including padding
    and magnification; this is the default
    {p_end}
{p2col:{cmdab:m:ap}}{it:offset} is in percent of the map's
    {help geoplot##refdim:reference size}, before processing any {cmd:zoom()} option and
    before processing {helpb geoplot##margin:margin()}
    {p_end}
{p2col:{opt a:bsolute}}{it:offset} is in absolute units of the map
    {p_end}

{phang2}
    {cmdab:pos:ition(}{it:x} {it:y} [{it:{help compassdirstyle}}]{cmd:)} moves
    the objects to the absolute position provided by coordinates {it:x} and
    {it:y}. Optional argument {it:{help compassdirstyle}} determines where the
    objects will be located relative to point ({it:x},{it:y}). The default is
    {cmd:0} (or {cmd:center}) which means that the objects will be centered
    at ({it:x},{it:y}). For example, specify {cmd:left} to place the objects to the left of
    ({it:x},{it:y}), or specify {cmd:se} to place the objects in south-east direction
    of ({it:x},{it:y}). Main arguments {it:offset} and {it:angle}, if specified, will
    be applied after {cmd:position()} has taken effect.

{phang2}
    {cmdab:ti:tle(}{cmd:"}{it:text}{cmd:"} [{cmd:"}{it:text}{cmd:"} ...][{cmd:,} {it:suboptions}]{cmd:)}
    adds a title to the zoom. Multiple lines are created if multiple
    {cmd:"}{it:text}{cmd:"} elements are specified. {it:suboptions} are
    {opth pos:ition(compassdirstyle)} to set the position
    of the title (default is at the top) as well as {it:{help textbox_options}} such
    as {cmd:color()} or {cmd:size()} to affect the rendering of the title; color
    options support {it:colorspec} as described in
    {helpb colorpalette##colorlist:colorpalette}. Option
    {cmd:title()} can be repeated to create multiple titles.

{phang2}
    {cmd:box}[{cmd:(}{it:which}{cmd:)}] displays the origin bounding box and
    the destination bounding box of the objects. Argument {it:which} can be
    {cmdab:d:estination} (print destination  box only) or
    {cmdab:o:rigin} (print origin box only). Only one of {cmd:box} and
    {cmd:circle} is allowed.

{phang2}
    {cmdab:cir:cle}[{cmd:(}{it:which}{cmd:)}] displays the origin MEC (minimum
    enclosing circle) and the destination MEC of the objects. Argument
    {it:which} can be {cmdab:d:estination} (print destination circle only) or
    {cmdab:o:rigin} (print origin circle only). Only
    one of {cmd:circle} and {cmd:box} is allowed.

{pmore2}
    By default, the positioning of the magnified objects is
    based on the midpoint and radius of the (rectangular)
    bounding box. However, if {cmd:circle()} is specified, the positioning is based on the
    midpoint and radius of the MEC. To use the MEC as basis without displaying
    the circles, you can type {cmd:circle(none)}.

{phang2}
    {opt pad:ding(#)} adds padding to the bounding box or MEC so that it does
    not touch the objects. Argument {it:#}
    is in percent of the radius of the (unpadded) bounding box or MEC. For example,
    type {cmd:padding(5)} to add 5% padding. Default is {cmd:padding(0)}.

{phang2}
    {opt nocon:nect} suppresses the connecting lines between origin and destination
    bounding boxes or MECs that are typically printed if {cmd:box}
    or {cmd:circle} is specified.

{phang2}
    {cmdab:con:nect}[{cmd:(}{it:options}{cmd:)}] enforces printing the
    connecting lines even if no bounding boxes or MECs are displayed and affects
    the rendering of the lines. {it:options} are as follows.

{p2colset 17 31 33 2}{...}
{p2col:{cmd:all}}requests that all four corners of the bounding
    boxes be connected; by default only the two outer corners are connected
    (i.e., the corners for which the connecting lines do not cross either the
    origin box or the destination box)
    {p_end}
{p2col:{it:{help line_options}}}affect the rendering of the connecting lines; for
    example, type {cmd:connect(lpattern(dash))} to use dashed lines
    {p_end}

{phang2}
    {it:{help area_options}} affect the look of the bounding boxes
    or MECs. For example, type {cmd:lcolor(cranberry)} to use red lines. The specified
    options also affect the connecting lines unless the options are overridden by options
    specified in {cmd:connect()}.

{pmore2}
    Note that bounding boxes and MECs generated by {cmd:zoom()}
    are printed on top of the map (i.e. in front of the existing
    objects). Adding fill to a bounding box or MEC will cover the
    objects lying behind it. To include a filled box or MEC that does not
    cover the objects, you may use {helpb geoframe##bbox:geoframe bbox} to
    generate a frame containing the coordinates of the box or MEC and then
    add it to the graph as regular layer using {it:layertype}
    {helpb geoplot##area:area}.

{marker inset}
{phang}
    {opt inset(spec)} creates an inset containing an additional
    map. Option {cmd:inset()} can be repeated to create multiple insets. The
    syntax of {it:spec} is

            {cmd:(}{it:layer}{cmd:)} [{cmd:(}{it:layer}{cmd:)} ...] [{cmd:,} {it:options} ]

{pmore}
or

            {it:layer} {cmd:||} [ {it:layer} {cmd:||} ...] [{cmd:,} {it:options} ]

{pmore}
    where {help geoplot##syntax:{it:layer}} is as described above and options
    are as follows.

{phang2}
    {opt below} prints the inset behind the main map. The default is to print the
    inset on top.

{phang2}
    {cmdab:ti:tle(}{cmd:"}{it:text}{cmd:"} [{cmd:"}{it:text}{cmd:"} ...][{cmd:,} {it:suboptions}]{cmd:)}
    adds a title to the inset. Multiple lines are created if multiple
    {cmd:"}{it:text}{cmd:"} elements are specified. {it:suboptions} are
    {opth pos:ition(compassdirstyle)} to set the position
    of the title (default is at the top) as well as {it:{help textbox_options}} such
    as {cmd:color()} or {cmd:size()} to affect the rendering of the title; color
    options support {it:colorspec} as described in
    {helpb colorpalette##colorlist:colorpalette}. Option
    {cmd:title()} can be repeated to create multiple titles.

{phang2}
    {opth box(area_options)} affects the rendering of frame around the
    inset. Color options in {it:area_options} support {it:colorspec} as
    described in {helpb colorpalette##colorlist:colorpalette}. Type {cmd:nobox}
    to omit the frame.

{phang2}
    {cmd:margin(}{it:marginexp}{cmd:)} sets the (inner) margin of the inset
    (i.e., the margin between the inset and its frame) in percent
    of the map's {help geoplot##refdim:reference size}, where {it:marginexp} is
    as described for global option {helpb geoplot##margin:margin()}. Default
    is {cmd:margin(1)} unless {cmd:nobox} is specified, in which case the default
    is {cmd:margin(0)}.

{phang2}
    {opth pos:ition(compassdirstyle)} determines the location of the inset in
    the plotregion of the graph. Default is {cmd:position(0)} (in the
    center). For example, type {cmd:position(ne)} to place the inset in the
    upper right corner.

{phang2}
    {opt si:ze(#)} sets the size of the inset (excluding margin) in percent
    of the map's {help geoplot##refdim:reference size}. Default
    is {cmd:size(30)} which means that the width (or height) of the inset will
    be 30% of the width (or height) of the plotregion. You may also type
    {cmd:size(.)} to omit rescaling and print the
    inset in its original size. In any case, however, the size of the inset will
    be restricted in such a way that it fits into the plotregion of the main map.

{phang2}
    {opt xm:argin(#)} and {opt ym:argin(#)} specify how much the
    inset will be moved away from the edge of the plotregion, in percent
    of the map's {help geoplot##refdim:reference size}. The default
    for is {cmd:xmargin(0)} and {cmd:ymargin(0)} unless {cmd:title()} is specified,
    in which case the default is {cmd:xmargin(3)} and {cmd:ymargin(3)}.

{phang2}
    {cmdab:back:ground}[{cmd:(}{it:options}{cmd:)}] adds a background to the
    inset map; see global option {helpb geoplot##background:background()}.

{phang2}
    {cmd:grid}[{cmd:(}{it:options}{cmd:)}] adds gridlines to the inset map;
    see global option {helpb geoplot##grid:grid()}.

{phang2}
    {cmdab:proj:ect}[{cmd:(}{it:spec}{cmd:)}] applies the specified projection
    to the inset map; see global option {helpb geoplot##project:project()}. The
    default is to apply the same projection as for the main map. Type
    {cmdab:noproj:ect} to omit projection for the inset map.

{phang2}
    {opt ang:le(angle)} rotates the inset map by {it:angle}
    degrees (counterclockwise). {cmd:rotate()} is a synonym for
    {cmd:angle()}. The default is to apply rotation as set by
    global option {helpb geoplot##angle:angle()}; type {cmd:angle(0)} to omit
    rotation for the inset map.

{marker tight}{...}
{phang}
    {opt tight} adjusts the size of the overall graph such that it tightly fits
    the map. If {cmd:tight} is not specified, the size of the graph is as set by
    the chosen {help scheme:graph scheme}. Specify {cmd:tight} to remove
    possible white space. By default, {cmd:tight} preserves the vertical size
    of the graph and adjust the horizontal size such that the graph has the
    same aspect ratio as the map. However, if {helpb region_options:xsize()}
    is specified, the vertical size is adjusted. If {helpb region_options:xsize()}
    and {helpb region_options:ysize()} are both specified, {cmd:tight} has no effect.

{pmore}
    Note that {cmd:tight} may not remove all white space if elements outside the
    plot region, e.g. a {helpb title_options:title()}, are added to the
    graph (in this case the available space for the map may have a different
    aspect ratio than the overall graph, which means that the map will not use up
    all available space). Also note that, by default, {cmd:geoplot} includes a small margin around
    the plotregion such that the map will not touch the edges of the
    graph. Specify {helpb region_options:graphregion(margin(zero))} to remove
    this outer margin.

{marker margin}{...}
{phang}
    {cmd:margin(}{it:marginexp}{cmd:)} sets the margin by which
    the plotregion extends the size of the map, where {it:marginexp} is
    {it:#} [{it:#} {it:#} {it:#}] or one or more elements of the form

            {{cmd:l}|{cmd:r}|{cmd:b}|{cmd:t}} [{cmd:=}] {it:#}

{pmore}
    such as {cmd:l=5} or {cmd:t=10}. Default is {cmd:margin(0)},
    which means that the plotregion will tightly fit the map. Specify, for example,
    {cmd:margin(1)} to increase the plotregion by 1 percent on each side of the
    map. Specify {cmd:margin(}{it:#} {it:#} {it:#} {it:#}{cmd:)} to use different
    margins on the left, right, bottom, and top (numbers will be recycled if
    less than four numbers are specified). For example, {cmd:margin(10 5 0 7)}
    will increase the plotregion by 10 percent on the left, 5 percent on the
    right, 0 percent at the bottom, and 7 percent at the top. Alternatively, use
    the {{cmd:l}|{cmd:r}|{cmd:b}|{cmd:t}}{cmd:=}{it:#}
    syntax. For example, {cmd:margin(r=5 t=10)} will increase the plotregion
    by 5 percent on the right and by 10 at the top (and by 0 percent on the other
    sides). The default reference for computing the margins is the minimum of the horizontal
    and vertical size of the map; also see option {helpb geoplot##refdim:refdim()}.

{pmore}
    {cmd:margin()} may be useful, for example, if you need to make space for a
    legend, such that it does not cover parts of the map. Note that, by default,
    {cmd:geoplot} also includes a small margin around the plotregion. Specify option
    {helpb region_options:graphregion(margin(zero))} to remove this outer margin.

{marker refdim}{...}
{phang}
    {cmd:refdim(}{it:spec}{cmd:)} selects the reference dimension for size
    calculations by {helpb geoplot##margin:margin()}, {helpb geoplot##inset:inset()},
    {helpb geoplot##glegend:glegend()},
    {helpb geoplot##compass:compass()}, and
    {helpb geoplot##sbar:sbar()}. {it:spec} may be {cmd:y} or
    {cmdab:v:ertical} for the vertical dimension, or {cmd:x} or {cmdab:h:orizontal}
    for the horizontal dimension. If {cmd:refdim()} is omitted, the
    minimum of the horizontal and vertical size of the map is used as the
    reference size.

{marker aspect}{...}
{phang}
    {cmd:aspectratio(}[{it:#}] [{cmd:,} {it:pos_option}]{cmd:)} may be used to
    adjust the aspect ratio of the map and to determine the placement of the
    plotregion in the graph. By default, {cmd:geoplot} sets the aspect ratio
    in a way such that horizontal and vertical distances are proportional to
    the numeric values of the coordinates. Specify {opt aspectratio(#)} to multiply
    the aspect ratio determined by {cmd:geoplot} by {it:#} (values between 0 and 1
    will compress the map vertically, values larger than 1 will compress the map
    horizontally). For {it:pos_option} see help {it:{help aspect_option}}.

{marker axes}{...}
{phang}
    {cmd:axes} turns the display of Stata's default coordinate system on
    (axes and axis labels, plot and graph region styles as set by the current
    scheme). By default, axes are suppressed, region styles are set to none, and
    {cmd:bgcolor()} (an apparently undocumented option to set the color of the
    canvas that becomes visible if the graph region has no color) is set to
    white.

{marker twopts}{...}
{phang}
    {it:twoway_options} are general twoway options, other than {cmd:by()}, as
    documented in help {it:{help twoway_options}}.

{marker frame}{...}
{phang}
    {cmd:frame(}{it:name}[{cmd:,} {cmd:replace} {cmdab:nocur:rent}]{cmd:)}
    stores the compiled data of the plot in a {helpb frame} called
    {it:name}. Applying the command in {cmd:r(graph)} to the frame
    will reproduce the map. Option {cmd:replace} allows overwriting
    an existing frame. Option {cmd:nocurrent} does not make the created frame
    the current frame.

{marker nograph}{...}
{phang}
    {opt nograph} suppresses the graph. The graph command will still be
    returned in {cmd:r(graph)}, but the command will not be executed. Use option
    {cmd:nograph} if you are only interested in obtaining the compiled data
    using option {helpb geoplot##frame:frame()} and do not want to waste
    computer time on rendering the graph.
